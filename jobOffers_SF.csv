11,Data Scientist, Supercell,"San Francisco, CA"," DescriptionDo you actively question the orthodoxy, convention, and dogma held by your peers and/or the broader gaming industry? Are you tired of making decisions purely based on data with no intuition? Do you enjoy the challenge of a highly dynamic ecosystem and an unpredictable industry? If so, this is the team for you!Like all analytics teams, we believe that extracting actionable insight from data is the bedrock of good decision-making ... where we differ is in two key beliefs. First, the best decisions rely not solely on data, but also on intuition grounded in years of knowledge and experience. Second, if we only do marketing that we can easily or cleanly measure, we will fail.If you thrive in a culture of healthy debate and are just as comfortable standing up for your ideas as you are changing your mind in the face of compelling evidence, logic, or intuition, then we want to hear from you. If you enjoy flipping seamlessly between the strategic big picture and the nuts and bolts, then we want to hear from you. If you can solve a Rubik‰Ûªs cube with one hand while winning a Clash Royale match with the other, it‰Ûªs not really relevant (but we still want to hear from you).About the roleFood for thought: How might we measure the impact of placing a massive ""Hog Rider"" statue in Asia's largest underground mall? How would you decide whether we should show an ad in next year's Super Bowl? How should we think about the value of players who don't spend a cent, but contribute heavily to a game's community?If tackling these kinds of questions gets you fired up, let's talk.With over 100 million people playing our games every day, marketing at Supercell operates in uncharted territory, and analytics & data science are the compass. Always on the cutting edge of mobile advertising, marketers at Supercell experiment aggressively and adjust on the fly. We collect data and nurture intuition and constantly balance between the two while making strategic recommendations and tactical optimizations to guide everything from massive global multi-channel marketing campaigns to agile hyper-local experiments.Above all, data scientists at Supercell enjoy partnering with colleagues to answer critical and difficult questions.

12,Data Scientist, Supercell,"San Francisco, CA"," DescriptionDo you actively question the orthodoxy, convention, and dogma held by your peers and/or the broader gaming industry? Are you tired of making decisions purely based on data with no intuition? Do you enjoy the challenge of a highly dynamic ecosystem and an unpredictable industry? If so, this is the team for you!Like all analytics teams, we believe that extracting actionable insight from data is the bedrock of good decision-making ... where we differ is in two key beliefs. First, the best decisions rely not solely on data, but also on intuition grounded in years of knowledge and experience. Second, if we only do marketing that we can easily or cleanly measure, we will fail.If you thrive in a culture of healthy debate and are just as comfortable standing up for your ideas as you are changing your mind in the face of compelling evidence, logic, or intuition, then we want to hear from you. If you enjoy flipping seamlessly between the strategic big picture and the nuts and bolts, then we want to hear from you. If you can solve a Rubik‰Ûªs cube with one hand while winning a Clash Royale match with the other, it‰Ûªs not really relevant (but we still want to hear from you).About the roleFood for thought: How might we measure the impact of placing a massive ""Hog Rider"" statue in Asia's largest underground mall? How would you decide whether we should show an ad in next year's Super Bowl? How should we think about the value of players who don't spend a cent, but contribute heavily to a game's community?If tackling these kinds of questions gets you fired up, let's talk.With over 100 million people playing our games every day, marketing at Supercell operates in uncharted territory, and analytics & data science are the compass. Always on the cutting edge of mobile advertising, marketers at Supercell experiment aggressively and adjust on the fly. We collect data and nurture intuition and constantly balance between the two while making strategic recommendations and tactical optimizations to guide everything from massive global multi-channel marketing campaigns to agile hyper-local experiments.Above all, data scientists at Supercell enjoy partnering with colleagues to answer critical and difficult questions. They only care about getting to the best POV, regardless of whether that requires a rigorous statistical model, a simplistic ad hoc approach, or more likely some combination of multiple lenses.

61,Data Scientist, Supercell,"San Francisco, CA"," DescriptionDo you actively question the orthodoxy, convention, and dogma held by your peers and/or the broader gaming industry? Are you tired of making decisions purely based on data with no intuition? Do you enjoy the challenge of a highly dynamic ecosystem and an unpredictable industry? If so, this is the team for you!Like all analytics teams, we believe that extracting actionable insight from data is the bedrock of good decision-making ... where we differ is in two key beliefs. First, the best decisions rely not solely on data, but also on intuition grounded in years of knowledge and experience. Second, if we only do marketing that we can easily or cleanly measure, we will fail.If you thrive in a culture of healthy debate and are just as comfortable standing up for your ideas as you are changing your mind in the face of compelling evidence, logic, or intuition, then we want to hear from you. If you enjoy flipping seamlessly between the strategic big picture and the nuts and bolts, then we want to hear from you. If you can solve a Rubik‰Ûªs cube with one hand while winning a Clash Royale match with the other, it‰Ûªs not really relevant (but we still want to hear from you).About the roleFood for thought: How might we measure the impact of placing a massive ""Hog Rider"" statue in Asia's largest underground mall? How would you decide whether we should show an ad in next year's Super Bowl? How should we think about the value of players who don't spend a cent, but contribute heavily to a game's community?If tackling these kinds of questions gets you fired up, let's talk.With over 100 million people playing our games every day, marketing at Supercell operates in uncharted territory, and analytics & data science are the compass. Always on the cutting edge of mobile advertising, marketers at Supercell experiment aggressively and adjust on the fly. We collect data and nurture intuition and constantly balance between the two while making strategic recommendations and tactical optimizations to guide everything from massive global multi-channel marketing campaigns to agile hyper-local experiments.Above all, data scientists at Supercell enjoy partnering with colleagues to answer critical and difficult questions. They only care about getting to the best POV, regardless of whether that requires a rigorous statistical model, a simplistic ad hoc approach, or more likely some combination of multiple lenses. Our data scientists are not secluded Ivory Tower wizards, but collaborative problem-solvers. The qualities we look for:Collaborative: you enjoy working hand-in-hand with colleagues more than notStrategic: you always have the strategic question in sight, and never get lost in the details or enamored with an inferior but intellectually more interesting approachStorytelling: You are adept at weaving compelling, thoughtful narratives from dataSkeptical: you relish playing devil's advocate and being a professional, constructive skepticFearless: you are unafraid of uncertainty, and don't get paralyzed when grappling with tricky questions or lack of good dataAdaptable: you are fully comfortable working in a team and industry that are constantly shifting and evolvingRequirements5+ years of experience translating data to insight to recommendationsBS (MS/PhD Preferred) in quant discipline (e.g. Math/Hard Science, Stats, CS, EE, Econ)Strong skills in SQL, R, and PythonExperience in time series analytics and machine learning models is a plusExperienceDevelop and evolve statistical models to guide measurement and optimizationPilot new methods to measure brand new types of marketing effortsDesign and own marketing experiments in partnership with our Media teamBridge the gap from data and analysis to critical business decisionsProvide a data-driven POV to balance our team intuitionTravel at your own discretion to our offices in Helsinki, Tokyo, Seoul and ChinaWhy you'll love it hereIndependence and lack of bureaucracyOpportunity to work with a team of gaming veterans, art veterans, top talent and passionate gamersEasy-going, enthusiastic, open and at the same time, a very results-driven cultureGreat compensation and benefits.

If you love games and are passionate about playing and crafting them, and you are looking for a job that provides you ownership and independence, this is the right place.Supercell isn't an entertainment company, it isn't a start-up, and it isn't just any game company. our focus sets us apart. Focus means saying to to a lot. To release four games we have killed fourteen. We've shut down marketing campaigns because they weren't perfect for our players, and we've scrapped a ton of game features that were simply too niche.We also believe that focus means staying small.

Use those metrics to improve processes not to punish your employees. Analyse your people based on their dedication, flexibility and williness to help others.

There is lot of favoritism. Some honest people are doing the job by following the processes, while others are taking short cuts to get good metrics and are the first to be promoted because promotions are based on numbers and not based on your hard work and dedication.Advice to ManagementYes metrics are important but are not always right. Use those metrics to improve processes not to punish your employees. Analyse your people based on their dedication, flexibility and williness to help others. I had a lot of dreams when I came here but I came to the realization that not matters how much dedication I give, I won't be part of the favoritism group. Time to follow my dreams in a new place.
